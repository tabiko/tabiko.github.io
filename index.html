<p>Beach sand provenance and dispersal along the Morro Bay littoral cell, California, USA
• Project Overview - Graduate research project was to utilize a sediment analysis method called sand provenance study to identify potential point sources of the beach sands from streams flowing into the Morro Bay littoral cell.  This project was to be the first detailed sand provenance analysis conducted for the beaches the Morro Bay littoral cell, and was aimed at providing insight into the sources, sinks, and pathways of this coastal sediment environment. 
• Field work  - Sand samples were taken from various beach locations, as well as from the streams that are identified as potential point sources.  All locations were marked with GPS and mapped, and all sand samples were logged.
• Analysis - A combination of analysis methods were to be utilized, and  include the following: 
1) Streamflow Data - Analysis of streamflow data and recent hydrologic reports from the San Luis Obispo County Public Works Department
2) Grain-size analysis  - To determine depositional environments and help decipher depositional processes and conditions
3) Petrographical analysis – Analysis of thin sections of the sand samples with an optical petrographic microscope.  Point counting methods would be utilized to reconstruct detrital compositions (independent of grain size), and to also determine modal abundances of heavy mineral fraction. 
4) Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscope (CCSEM)  - Analysis of CCSEM grain mounted slides to determine sand grain morphology and provide precise chemical compositions. 
5) Sediment Transport Analysis - Analysis of coastal oceanographic conditions, particularly the longshore current direction and the effects of seasonal ocean currents using data from the NOAA National Date Buoy Center and Scripps' Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP).  </p>

<p>Pikes Peak Highway Erosion and Sedimentation Control Project,
Rocky Mountain Field Institute (RMFI), Colorado Springs, CO, 2008
• Assisted study of tree core samples to determine if dendrochronological record can support the hypothesis that the source of the erosion is not natural in occurrence.
• Took measurements of the rate of slide movement in order to forecast the negative impact on the headwaters of a creek inhabited by a threatened species of trout.
• Assessed damage of hiking trails caused by the erosion of the highway.</p>
