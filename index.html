	<img src="http://i.imgur.com/hQsgMc5.png" />
		<p>On August 7th, 2014,the logo I designed for our GIS lab, Division 6, went live!</p>
		<p>Represents the CAL FIRE San Luis Obispo Unit's Pre-Fire Division</p>
		<p>This is the division under which SLU's GIs happens!</p>
		<p>The logo was inspired by the reauleaux triangle,</p>
		<p>which is deriveed from three intertwined circles.</p>
		<p>The colors are the same RGB's as the CAL FIRE logo.</p>
