This project was to be the first detailed sand provenance analysis conducted for the beaches the Morro Bay littoral cell, and was aimed at providing insight into the sources, sinks, and pathways of this coastal sediment environment. \r\n\r\n* Field work  - Sand samples were taken from various beach locations, as well as from the streams that are identified as potential point sources.  All locations were marked with GPS and mapped, and all sand samples were logged.\r\n\r\n* Analysis - A combination of analysis methods were to be utilized, and  include the following:\r\n \r\n1. *Streamflow Data* - Analysis of streamflow data and recent hydrologic reports from the San Luis Obispo County Public Works Department\r\n\r\n2. *Grain-size analysis*  - To determine depositional environments and help decipher depositional processes and conditions.\r\n\r\n3. *Petrographical analysis* – Analysis of thin sections of the sand samples with an optical petrographic microscope.  Point counting methods would be utilized to reconstruct detrital compositions (independent of grain size), and to also determine modal abundances of heavy mineral fraction.\r\n \r\n4. *Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscope (CCSEM)*  - Analysis of CCSEM grain mounted slides to determine sand grain morphology and provide precise chemical compositions.\r\n \r\n5. *Sediment Transport Analysis* - Analysis of coastal oceanographic conditions, particularly the longshore current direction and the effects of seasonal ocean currents using data from the NOAA National Date Buoy Center and Scripps' Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP).  \r\n  \r\n\r\n### Graduate Research Grant (2011)\r\n**The California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology (COAST)**\r\n\r\n* Summer 2011 COAST Student Award for Marine Science Research\r\n\r\n* $1,500 awarded (upon acceptance of grant proposal on July 2011)\r\n\r\n* Award was utilized to assist in travel expenses and the purchase of equipment to begin research for Masters Thesis project (described above)\r\n\r\n### Research Assistant (2008)\r\n**Pikes Peak Highway Erosion and Sedimentation Control Project, Rocky Mountain Field Institute (RMFI), Colorado Springs, CO, 2008**\r\n\r\n* Assisted study of tree core samples to determine if dendrochronological record can support the hypothesis that the source of the erosion is not natural in occurrence.\r\n\r\n* Took measurements of the rate of slide movement in order to forecast the negative impact on the headwaters of a creek inhabited by a threatened species of trout.\r\n\r\n* Assessed damage of hiking trails caused by the erosion of the highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n## COMPUTER SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE\r\n* ArcGIS Desktop 10.2: ArcMap, ArcScene, ArcGlobe, ArcCatalog, 3D Analyst, Geostatistical Analyst, Spatial Analyst\r\n\r\n* Micro Images TNTmips (Map and Image Processing System)\r\n\r\n* GST Mapper (GeoSpatial Technologies, Inc.), the emergency response navigation systems for CAL FIRE mobile data computers\r\n\r\n* Quantum GIS (Open Source GIS)\r\n\r\n* Open Street Map and JOSM Editor (Open Source GIS)\r\n\r\n* Open Source graphic design programs – GIMP and Inkscape\r\n\r\n* GitHub – Web-based repository with version control and source code management, utilizing Markdown code language\r\n\r\n* Google Earth\r\n\r\n* Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, Publisher, PowerPoint\r\n\r\n* Adobe: Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Photoshop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## TECHNICAL AND EQUIPMENT EXPERIENCE\r\n* ViaSat Surf Beam 2 Pro Portable – Durable, portable high speed satellite internet and data dish for remote incident communications.\r\n \r\n* Mobile Data Computer – Vehicle mounted Panasonic Toughbook for emergency and field work navigation.\r\n\r\n* Tablet (Android or Mac) – Utilized for mapping, navigation, and GPS-related apps, as well as PDF Maps for recording digital field notes (transferred into shapfiles for use with ArcGIS)\r\n\r\n* GPS Units – Garmin 60CSX, DeLorme InReach Explorer\r\n\r\n\r\n## RELEVANT INTERESTS\r\n* GIS - Natural Hazard Analysis, Environmental Applications\r\n\r\n* Geology - Erosion and Landslide Management, Sediment Provenance and Dispersal, Stratigraphy, River Systems\r\n\r\n* Other Environmental - Anadromous Fish Species Conservation, Human-Nature Interface\r\n\r\n\r\n## OTHER EXPERIENCE\r\n* Over 10 years working in Housing and Residential Life (Student Affairs) at various universities, gaining experience in the field of higher education and personnel administration.\r\n\r\n* Freelance Graphic Designer  \r\n  \r\n\r\n## GIS WORKS\r\n\r\n###Beach Sand/Sediment Transport Research\r\nAnalysis of the Morro Bay Littoral Cell and associated hydrologic sub-units.
